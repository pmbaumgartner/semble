Semble is a code search library built for agents. It returns the exact code snippets they need instantly, using ~98% fewer tokens than grep+read and cutting latency on every step. Indexing and searching a full codebase end-to-end takes under a second, with ~200x faster indexing and ~10x faster queries than a code-specialized transformer, at 99% of its retrieval quality (see [benchmarks](#benchmarks)). Everything runs on CPU with no API keys, GPU, or external services. Run it as an [MCP server](#mcp-server) and any agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, etc.) gets instant access to any repo, cloned and indexed on demand.

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install semble  # Install with pip
uv add semble       # Install with uv
```

```python
from semble import SembleIndex

# Index a local directory
index = SembleIndex.from_path("./my-project")

# Index a remote git repository
index = SembleIndex.from_git("https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec")

# Search the index with a natural-language or code query
results = index.search("save model to disk", top_k=3)

# Find code similar to a specific result
related = index.find_related(results[0], top_k=3)

# Find duplicate-code candidates
duplicates = index.find_duplicates(top_k=3)

# Each result exposes the matched chunk
result = results[0]
result.chunk.file_path   # "model2vec/model.py"
result.chunk.start_line  # 127
result.chunk.end_line    # 150
result.chunk.content     # "def save_pretrained(self, path: PathLike, ..."
```

## Main Features

- **Fast**: indexes a repo in ~250 ms and answers queries in ~1.5 ms, all on CPU.
- **Accurate**: NDCG@10 of 0.854 on our [benchmarks](#benchmarks), on par with code-specialized transformer models, at a fraction of the size and cost.
- **Token-efficient**: returns only the relevant chunks, using ~98% fewer tokens than grep+read.
- **Zero setup**: runs on CPU with no API keys, GPU, or external services required.
- **MCP server**: drop-in tool for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and any other MCP-compatible agent.
- **Local and remote**: pass a local path or a git URL.

## MCP Server

Semble can run as an MCP server so agents can search any codebase directly. Repos are cloned and indexed on demand, and indexes are cached for the lifetime of the session.

### Setup

> Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to be installed.

#### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add semble -s user -- uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble
```

#### Codex
Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[mcp_servers.semble]
command = "uvx"
args = ["--from", "semble[mcp]", "semble"]
```

#### OpenCode
Add to `~/.opencode/config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "semble": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["uvx", "--from", "semble[mcp]", "semble"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor
Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "semble": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "semble[mcp]", "semble"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | Search a codebase with a natural-language or code query. Pass `repo` as a git URL or local path. |
| `find_related` | Given a file path and line number, return chunks semantically similar to the code at that location. |
| `find_duplicates` | Find duplicate implementations and refactoring candidates in a codebase. |

### Sub-agent support

Claude Code and Codex CLI lazy-load MCP tool schemas, so sub-agents cannot call `mcp__semble__search` directly. The fix is to invoke semble through the [CLI](#cli) via Bash instead.

**Claude Code**: run this once in your project root:

```bash
semble init
# or, if semble is not on $PATH:
uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble init
```

This writes [`.claude/agents/semble-search.md`](src/semble/agents/semble-search.md).

**Other tools (Codex, etc.)**: append the following to your `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Code Search

Use `semble search` to find code by describing what it does or naming a symbol/identifier, instead of grep:

​```bash
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project
semble search "save_pretrained" ./my-project
semble search "save model to disk" ./my-project --top-k 10
​```

Use `semble find-related` to discover code similar to a known location (pass `file_path` and `line` from a prior search result):

​```bash
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project
​```

Use `semble find-duplicates` to identify duplicate implementations, copy-pasted logic, and refactoring candidates:

​```bash
semble find-duplicates ./my-project
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --language python
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --candidate-k 24
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --include-tests
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --exclude tests --exclude src/generated
​```

`path` defaults to the current directory when omitted; git URLs are accepted. Duplicate discovery excludes tests by default; pass `--include-tests` to include them.

If `semble` is not on `$PATH`, use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble` in its place.

## Workflow

1. Start with `semble search` to find relevant chunks.
2. Inspect full files only when the returned chunk is not enough context.
3. Optionally use `semble find-related` with a promising result's `file_path` and `line` to discover related implementations.
4. Use `semble find-duplicates` when looking for duplicate implementations, copy-pasted logic, or refactoring candidates.
5. Use grep only when you need exhaustive literal matches or quick confirmation of an exact string.
```

## CLI

Semble also ships as a standalone CLI for use outside of MCP. This is useful in scripts, sub-agents, or anywhere you want search results without an MCP session.

```bash
# Search a local repo
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project

# Search for a symbol or identifier
semble search "save_pretrained" ./my-project

# Search a remote repo (cloned on demand)
semble search "save model to disk" https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec

# Find code similar to a known location (file_path and line from a prior search result)
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project

# Find duplicate-code candidates in a local repo
semble find-duplicates ./my-project

# Find duplicate-code candidates in a remote repo
semble find-duplicates https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec

# Limit duplicate discovery to one language
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --language python

# Inspect more semantic neighbors per chunk for higher duplicate recall
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --candidate-k 24

# Include tests in duplicate discovery
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --include-tests

# Exclude tests and generated code from duplicate discovery
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --exclude tests --exclude src/generated
```

`path` defaults to the current directory when omitted; git URLs are accepted. Duplicate discovery excludes tests by default.

If `semble` is not on `$PATH`, use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble` in its place.

## How it works

Semble splits each file into code-aware chunks using [Chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie), then scores every query against the chunks with two complementary retrievers: static [Model2Vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec) embeddings using the code-specialized [potion-code-16M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-code-16M) model for semantic similarity, and [BM25](https://github.com/xhluca/bm25s) for lexical matches on identifiers and API names. The two score lists are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

After fusing, results are reranked with a set of code-aware signals:

<details>
<summary><b>Ranking signals</b></summary>

- **Adaptive weighting.** Symbol-like queries (`Foo::bar`, `_private`, `getUserById`) get more lexical weight, while natural-language queries stay balanced between semantic and lexical retrievers.
- **Definition boosts.** A chunk that defines the queried symbol (a `class`, `def`, `func`, etc.) is ranked above chunks that merely reference it.
- **Identifier stems.** Query tokens are stemmed and matched against identifier stems in a chunk, giving an additional weight to chunks that contain them. For example, querying `parse config` boosts chunks containing `parseConfig`, `ConfigParser`, or `config_parser`.
- **File coherence.** When multiple chunks from the same file match the query, the file is boosted so the top result reflects broad file-level relevance rather than a single out-of-context chunk.
- **Noise penalties.** Test files, `compat/`/`legacy/` shims, example code, and `.d.ts` declaration stubs are down-ranked so canonical implementations surface first.

</details>

Because the embedding model is static with no transformer forward pass at query time, all of this runs in milliseconds on CPU.

## Benchmarks

We benchmark quality and speed across all methods on ~1,250 queries over 63 repositories in 19 languages. The x-axis is total latency (index + first query); the y-axis is NDCG@10. Marker size reflects model parameter count.

![Speed vs quality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinishLab/semble/main/assets/images/speed_vs_ndcg_cold.png)

| Method | NDCG@10 | Index time | Query p50 |
|--------|--------:|-----------:|----------:|
| CodeRankEmbed Hybrid | 0.862 | 57 s | 16 ms |
| **semble** | **0.854** | **263 ms** | **1.5 ms** |
| CodeRankEmbed | 0.765 | 57 s | 16 ms |
| ColGREP | 0.693 | 5.8 s | 124 ms |
| BM25 | 0.673 | 263 ms | 0.02 ms |
| grepai | 0.561 | 35 s | 48 ms |
| probe | 0.387 | — | 207 ms |
| ripgrep | 0.126 | — | 12 ms |

Semble achieves 99% of the performance of the 137M-parameter [CodeRankEmbed](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed) Hybrid, while indexing 218x faster and answering queries 11x faster. See [benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md) for per-language results, ablations, and methodology.

### Token efficiency

Agents using grep+read spend most of their context budget on irrelevant code. Semble returns only the chunks that match, keeping token usage low even at high recall.

![Token efficiency: recall vs. retrieved tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinishLab/semble/main/assets/images/token_efficiency.png)

Semble uses **98% fewer tokens** on average, and reaches 94% recall at a budget of only 2k tokens, while grep+read needs a full 100k context window to reach 85%. See [benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md#token-efficiency) for details.
