Semble is a code search library built for agents. It returns the exact code snippets they need instantly, using ~98% fewer tokens than grep+read and cutting latency on every step. Indexing and searching a full codebase end-to-end takes under a second, with ~200x faster indexing and ~10x faster queries than a code-specialized transformer, at 99% of its retrieval quality (see [benchmarks](#benchmarks)). Everything runs on CPU with no API keys, GPU, or external services. Run it as an [MCP server](#mcp-server) or call it from the shell via [AGENTS.md](#bash-integration) and any agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, etc.) gets instant access to any repo.

## Quickstart

Your agent will automatically use Semble whenever it needs to find code. Instead of grepping with a keyword and reading full files, it queries in natural language (e.g. `"How is authentication handled?"`) and gets back only the relevant context. Semble can be set up as an MCP server or as a bash tool:

### MCP

Add Semble to Claude Code (requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)):

```bash
claude mcp add semble -s user -- uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble
```

Using another agent harness? See [MCP Server](#mcp-server) for setup instructions for Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, and other MCP clients.

### Bash / AGENTS.md

Install Semble first, then add the [code search snippet](#bash-integration) to your `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`:

```bash
pip install semble       # Install with pip
uv tool install semble   # Or install with uv
```

> Note: for Claude Code or Codex CLI sub-agents, use the [bash integration](#bash-integration) instead of, or alongside, MCP.

To update Semble, see [Updating](#updating).

Curious how many tokens Semble has saved you? Run `semble savings` to see. See [Savings](#savings) for details.

## Main Features

- **Fast**: indexes an average repo in ~250 ms and answers queries in ~1.5 ms, all on CPU.
- **Accurate**: NDCG@10 of 0.854 on our [benchmarks](#benchmarks), on par with code-specialized transformer models, at a fraction of the size and cost.
- **Token-efficient**: returns only the relevant chunks, using [~98% fewer tokens than grep+read](#token-efficiency).
- **Zero setup**: runs on CPU with no API keys, GPU, or external services required.
- **MCP server**: drop-in tool for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and any other MCP-compatible agent.
- **Local and remote**: pass a local path or a git URL.

## MCP Server

Semble can run as an MCP server so agents can search any codebase directly. Repos are cloned and indexed on demand, and indexes are cached for the lifetime of the session. Local paths are watched for file changes and re-indexed automatically.

### Setup

> Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to be installed.

#### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add semble -s user -- uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble
```

#### Codex
Add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
[mcp_servers.semble]
command = "uvx"
args = ["--from", "semble[mcp]", "semble"]
```

#### OpenCode
Add to `~/.opencode/config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "semble": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["uvx", "--from", "semble[mcp]", "semble"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor
Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "semble": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "semble[mcp]", "semble"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | Search a codebase with a natural-language or code query. Pass `repo` as a local directory path or an https:// git URL. |
| `find_related` | Given a file path and line number, return chunks semantically similar to the code at that location. |
| `find_duplicates` | Find grouped duplicate implementations and refactoring candidates in a codebase. |

`find_duplicates` also accepts duplicate-specific filters: `language`, `include_paths`, `exclude_paths`, `include_tests`, `include_data`, `include_scaffolding`, `min_lines`, `min_structural_score`, and `min_cluster_size`.


## Bash integration

An alternative to MCP is to invoke Semble via Bash. For Claude Code and Codex CLI, this is the only option for sub-agents, which cannot call MCP tools directly (both lazy-load MCP schemas at the top-level agent only).

To add Bash support, append the following to your `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Code Search

Use `semble search` to find code by describing what it does or naming a symbol/identifier, instead of grep:

​```bash
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project
semble search "save_pretrained" ./my-project
semble search "save model to disk" ./my-project --top-k 10
​```

Use `semble find-related` to discover code similar to a known location (pass `file_path` and `line` from a prior search result):

​```bash
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project
​```

Use `semble find-duplicates` to identify candidate duplicate implementations, copy-pasted logic, and refactoring opportunities:

​```bash
semble find-duplicates ./my-project
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --language python
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --include src --exclude tests --exclude src/generated
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --include src/app --include packages/core
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --min-cluster-size 3
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --include-tests
​```

`path` defaults to the current directory when omitted; git URLs are accepted. Duplicate discovery returns candidate clusters with at least two chunks and skips tests, static data/config, and import/header scaffolding by default. Treat results as leads to inspect, not confirmed problems; tree-sitter limits and language differences can produce false positives. Use `--include` to narrow duplicate discovery to one or more file/directory scopes. Use `--include-tests`, `--include-data`, or `--include-scaffolding` when duplicates in tests, fixtures/config, or boilerplate matter.

If `semble` is not on `$PATH`, use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble` in its place.

## Workflow

1. Start with `semble search` to find relevant chunks.
2. Inspect full files only when the returned chunk is not enough context.
3. Optionally use `semble find-related` with a promising result's `file_path` and `line` to discover related implementations.
4. Use `semble find-duplicates` when looking for candidate duplicate implementations, copy-pasted logic, or refactoring opportunities; verify clusters before changing code.
5. Use grep only when you need exhaustive literal matches or quick confirmation of an exact string.
```

**Claude Code sub-agent**: Claude Code also supports a dedicated sub-agent. Run this once in your project root:

```bash
semble init
# or, if semble is not on $PATH:
uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble init
```

This writes [`.claude/agents/semble-search.md`](src/semble/agents/semble-search.md).

## CLI

Semble also ships as a standalone CLI for use outside of MCP. This is useful in scripts or anywhere you want search results without an MCP session.

```bash
# Search a local repo
semble search "authentication flow" ./my-project

# Search for a symbol or identifier
semble search "save_pretrained" ./my-project

# Search a remote repo (cloned on demand)
semble search "save model to disk" https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec

# Find code similar to a known location (file_path and line from a prior search result)
semble find-related src/auth.py 42 ./my-project

# Find duplicate clusters in a local repo
semble find-duplicates ./my-project

# Find duplicate clusters in a remote repo
semble find-duplicates https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec

# Limit duplicate discovery to one language
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --language python

# Inspect more semantic neighbors per chunk for higher duplicate recall
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --candidate-k 24

# Loosen the structural-similarity floor
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --min-structural-score 0.35

# Focus on larger duplicate clusters
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --min-cluster-size 3

# Include tests in duplicate discovery
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --include-tests

# Include static data/config chunks in duplicate discovery
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --include-data

# Include import/header/attribute scaffolding in duplicate discovery
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --include-scaffolding

# Exclude tests and generated code from duplicate discovery
semble find-duplicates ./my-project --exclude tests --exclude src/generated
```

`path` defaults to the current directory when omitted; git URLs are accepted. Duplicate discovery returns clusters with at least two chunks by default, requires structural similarity of at least `0.40` per pair edge, and excludes tests, static data/config chunks, and import/header scaffolding by default. `find_duplicates()` skips test-looking chunks unless `include_tests=True`; the CLI `find-duplicates` command applies `--include`, `--exclude`, and `--include-tests` as duplicate-scan filters without changing the indexed file set.

If `semble` is not on `$PATH`, use `uvx --from "semble[mcp]" semble` in its place.

### Savings

`semble savings` shows how many tokens semble has saved across all your searches:

```bash
semble savings           # summary by period
semble savings --verbose # also show breakdown by call type
```

```
  Semble Token Savings
  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Period        Calls   Savings
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Today         42      [███████████████░]  ~58.4k tokens (95%)
  Last 7 days   287     [██████████████░░]  ~312.4k tokens (90%)
  All time      1.4k    [██████████████░░]  ~1.2M tokens (89%)
```

**How savings are calculated:** for each call, semble records the total character count of the unique files containing returned chunks and the character count of the snippets returned. Estimated tokens saved is `(file chars − snippet chars) / 4` (4 chars per token). This is a conservative estimate: the baseline is reading matched files in full, which is how coding agents often explore unfamiliar code.

Stats are stored in `~/.semble/savings.jsonl`.

### Updating

To update/upgrade Semble to the latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade semble   # with pip
uv tool upgrade semble         # with uv
uv cache clean semble          # for MCP users (restart your MCP client after)
```

## Python API

Semble can also be used as a Python library for programmatic access, useful when building custom tooling or integrating search directly into your own code.

```python
from semble import SembleIndex

# Index a local directory
index = SembleIndex.from_path("./my-project")

# Index a remote git repository
index = SembleIndex.from_git("https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec")

# Search the index with a natural-language or code query
results = index.search("save model to disk", top_k=3)

# Find code similar to a specific result
related = index.find_related(results[0], top_k=3)

# Find grouped duplicate implementations
duplicates = index.find_duplicates(top_k=3)

# Each result exposes the matched chunk
result = results[0]
result.chunk.file_path   # "model2vec/model.py"
result.chunk.start_line  # 127
result.chunk.end_line    # 150
result.chunk.content     # "def save_pretrained(self, path: PathLike, ..."
```

## How it works

Semble splits each file into code-aware chunks using [Chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie), then scores every query against the chunks with two complementary retrievers: static [Model2Vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec) embeddings using the code-specialized [potion-code-16M](https://huggingface.co/minishlab/potion-code-16M) model for semantic similarity, and [BM25](https://github.com/xhluca/bm25s) for lexical matches on identifiers and API names. The two score lists are fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).

After fusing, results are reranked with a set of code-aware signals:

<details>
<summary><b>Ranking signals</b></summary>

- **Adaptive weighting.** Symbol-like queries (`Foo::bar`, `_private`, `getUserById`) get more lexical weight, while natural-language queries stay balanced between semantic and lexical retrievers.
- **Definition boosts.** A chunk that defines the queried symbol (a `class`, `def`, `func`, etc.) is ranked above chunks that merely reference it.
- **Identifier stems.** Query tokens are stemmed and matched against identifier stems in a chunk, giving an additional weight to chunks that contain them. For example, querying `parse config` boosts chunks containing `parseConfig`, `ConfigParser`, or `config_parser`.
- **File coherence.** When multiple chunks from the same file match the query, the file is boosted so the top result reflects broad file-level relevance rather than a single out-of-context chunk.
- **Noise penalties.** Test files, `compat/`/`legacy/` shims, example code, and `.d.ts` declaration stubs are down-ranked so canonical implementations surface first.

</details>

Because the embedding model is static with no transformer forward pass at query time, all of this runs in milliseconds on CPU.

## Benchmarks

We benchmark quality and speed across all methods on ~1,250 queries over 63 repositories in 19 languages. The x-axis is total latency (index + first query); the y-axis is NDCG@10. Marker size reflects model parameter count.

![Speed vs quality](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinishLab/semble/main/assets/images/speed_vs_ndcg_cold.png)

| Method | NDCG@10 | Index time | Query p50 |
|--------|--------:|-----------:|----------:|
| CodeRankEmbed Hybrid | 0.862 | 57 s | 16 ms |
| **semble** | **0.854** | **263 ms** | **1.5 ms** |
| CodeRankEmbed | 0.765 | 57 s | 16 ms |
| ColGREP | 0.693 | 5.8 s | 124 ms |
| BM25 | 0.673 | 263 ms | 0.02 ms |
| grepai | 0.561 | 35 s | 48 ms |
| probe | 0.387 | — | 207 ms |
| ripgrep | 0.126 | — | 12 ms |

Semble achieves 99% of the performance of the 137M-parameter [CodeRankEmbed](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/CodeRankEmbed) Hybrid, while indexing 218x faster and answering queries 11x faster. See [benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md) for per-language results, ablations, and methodology.

### Token efficiency

Agents using grep+read spend most of their context budget on irrelevant code. Semble returns only the chunks that match, keeping token usage low even at high recall.

![Token efficiency: recall vs. retrieved tokens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MinishLab/semble/main/assets/images/token_efficiency.png)

Semble uses **98% fewer tokens** on average, and reaches 94% recall at a budget of only 2k tokens, while grep+read needs a full 100k context window to reach 85%. See [benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md#token-efficiency) for details.
